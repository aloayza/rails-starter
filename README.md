Rails Starter App Template

This template sets up a basic Ruby on Rails site that has a User model with login and password reset. The code is from Michael Hartl's excellent book, <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/" target="_blank">Rails Tutorial</a>. The CSS is based on Material Design. Email is also setup to work locally and with Heroku.
